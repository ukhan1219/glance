# Glance

## Inspiration
A love for finance, machine learning and AI

## What it does
Glance allows you to have multiple financial accounts in the same place to avoid the redundancy of checking multiple places. It also provides market information and curated AI insight based off of your spending habits and investments.

## How we built it
We built it using the T3 stack which incorporates TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and TRPC. We used other technologies such as Next.js, React.js, Node.js and Prisma. We hosted our database on Heroku, we used Figma for a design mockup and GitHub for version control and collaboration. API's we leveraged were Plaid, Gemini AI, and Polygon
## Challenges we ran into
Challenges we ran into were attempting to use crypto API's such as Binance, Coinbase and Robinhood as they were not feasible for scope of project (cost, time constraint, not a registered business).
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Incorporating multiple difficult API's including polygon and plaid, very few merge conflicts, successfully implemented oAuth to securely log users in and used a modern stack such as T3 with no one on our team having prior knowledge on it.
## What we learned
Learned how easy using a framework makes it to create a program from scratch, we learned how to route API's, and how connecting some API's are much more difficult than others.
## What's next for Glance
We will continue to work on this as we are both passionate about finance and making it easily accessible to all. We also have a strong interest in ML/AI technologies and we feel this project was able to highlight some of our skills and we hope you enjoy our product now and in the future with newer developments and updates. We will continue working on this and plan to expand our operations and feature-set in the future.
